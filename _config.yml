          I did this project as a part of my training in <mark>Design Verification</mark>. Have developed the testbench for 8-bit ALU which is easily configurable. I explored different UVM components while doing this project specially about <b>TLM Ports</b> and <b>UVM Reporting</b><hr>

          This was the most challenging project which I had done during this training.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project was also done by me as part of my training in <mark>Design Verification</mark>. This is a complete testbench with and without UVM for a single APB slave cofiguration (slave is taken as memory). Through this project, I learnt a lot about the AMBA specifications specially <b>APB</b> protocols. Apart from protocol, it gave me a hands-on experience to design the complete testbench architecture from scratch along with the test plan. Also, I got to know the advantage of using UVM to design Test bench over raw SV test bench.

          Key concepts learned: <mark>APB protocol</mark> <mark>Debugging</mark> <mark>TB Architecutre Design</mark>

          My journy began as a fresh graduate and got 6 months training in Quality Department of Midea China factory. This training gave me a lot of technical experience and at the same time it helped me to learn to deal the cross-culture difference. After successfull completion of my training I was involved in BIS and ISO certification of India plant, during which I made/translated 50-60 ISO documents and shop floor documents.

          I worked in the telecommand division of ITR, which is mainly focused on sending commands to the test device. My team was assigned for a project which aimed to develop an indigeneous <b>AGC</b> (Automatic Gain controller) for a 10W transmitter. This project gave me a lot of insights about the working of transmitter and the need for AGCs in transmitter. Also, I got hands on experience with high end oscilloscopes, function generator and spectrometers.

          During my college, I was deeply involved in various projects, mainly of research background. My academic project was a research-based project on MIMO Scheduling, titled "Scheduling of users in MIMO communication using PSO"

          <b>MIMO</b> (Multiple Input Multiple Output) is the key principle for 5G communication and scheduling of users in MIMO is the biggest challenge in base station due to the high computational power required. In this project, we used PSO technique to schedule the users with less computational power.

      Alongside my interests in electroics and software fields I also like to cook and exploring and learning new things.
      I used to refresh my mind through cooking and learning new things is my favourite time pass.
